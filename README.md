# Bank-Prediction
This is a set of nns on the bank employee leaving public dataset
There are different jupyter notebooks where I have used different layers or activation functions or with tensorflow 2
I have also included the dataset used for the models, with the name of Churn Modelling
The networks have an accuracy of about 85%
